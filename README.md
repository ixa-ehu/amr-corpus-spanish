## Spanish AMR annotations

The file **es-Little-Prince-Corpus-50-AMR.txt** contains the 50 Spanish sentences that were manually annotated. Futhermore, it includes the following metadata:

+ ::id → llp_es.N, where "es" indicates that it is a Spanish sentence and "N" its ID number. The ID number corresponds to the ID number of their corresponding English sentence in the original English corpus (https://amr.isi.edu/download/amr-bank-v1.6.txt).
+ ::annotator → The nickname of the annotator.
+ ::tok → The sentence to be annotated.

## English AMR annotations

For convenience, we also include the 50 English sentences used to create the Spanish AMR annotations. These sentences and annotations taken without any modification to facilitate researchers any mapping between the English and the Spanish AMRs.

Thus, the file **en-Little-Prince-Corpus-50-AMR.txt** contains the 50 original English sentences and AMRs that were translated and annotated in Spanish. Furthermore, it includes the following metadata:

+ ::id → llp_en.N, where "en" indicates that it is an English sentence and "N" its ID number. The ID number corresponds to the ID number of their corresponding Spanish sentence.
+ ::annotator → lpp_1943.N, where "N" indicates its ID number within The Little Prince Corpus.
